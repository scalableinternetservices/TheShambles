# gTrack: Tracking Prices of Games Available in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)

## About
gTrack is a web app to track games available in Steam. It allows the user to observe the trend in change in prices of games. Apart from tracking prices, the app deals with various Steam's game related features such as emotes, backgrounds, and cards. Additionally, users are provided with multiple highly specialized search options to select games based on many different criteria. If you know Ruby on Rails, you would know how to go about using this repo. Please contact any one of us if you require the seed file (as it is 389Mb and can't be uploaded here). Happy coding.

P.S The chat doesn't work on Elastic Beanstalk.
